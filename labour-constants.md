# Labour Constants

Finding a single list of 500 labour constants for carpentry is not feasible, as this level of detailed, proprietary data is typically found only in specialized, paid construction cost databases and estimating manuals (often updated annually).
However, I can provide a concise list of constants for a wide range of carpentry tasks, drawing from various industry norms. These are typically expressed as Man-Hours per Unit (MH/Unit).
Labour Constants for Carpentry
| Category | Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| I. Rough Carpentry/Framing |  |  |  |
| Timber Wall Framing (Pre-cut) | Fix sole/head plates | m (linear) | 0.20 - 0.30 |
| Timber Wall Framing | Erect/brace wall frame sections | m$^2$ | 0.20 - 0.40 |
| Floor Framing | Fix timber bearer (e.g., 100x75mm) | m (linear) | \approx 0.15 |

Note: The unit BF (Board Foot) is a common measure in North American estimating. m is a linear meter, and m$^2$ is a square meter.



Labour constants for painting are typically expressed as Man-Hours per Square Meter (MH/m²) or Square Meters per Hour (m²/hr), which factor in prep time, application, and drying time across multiple coats.
Constants vary based on the surface, quality of finish, number of coats, and method of application (brush, roller, or spray).
Here are key examples:
Painting Labour Constants (Tradesman Hours per Unit)
| Task / Description | Unit | Coats/Finish | Man-Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interior Walls (Previously painted) | m$^2$ | Prepare, fill, sand, spot prime, 2 coats acrylic | \approx 0.22 hours/m$^2$ |
| Interior Walls (New plaster) | m$^2$ | 2 coats emulsion to plaster | \approx 0.125 hours/m$^2$ (or 8 m$^2$/hr) |
| Ceilings/Soffits | m$^2$ | Repaint in 2 coats (good condition) | \approx 0.18 hours/m$^2$ |
| Interior Timber/Metal (General Surfaces) | m$^2$ | Prepare and apply 2 coats acrylic | \approx 0.23 hours/m$^2$ |
| External Timber (New) | m$^2$ | Prime new timber | \approx 0.11 hours/m$^2$ |
| External Timber (New) | m$^2$ | Knot, 1 prime, 2 undercoat, 1 gloss | \approx 0.67 hours/m$^2$ (or 1.5 m$^2$/hr) |
| Clear Varnish Refinishing | m$^2$ | Wash, sand, 2 coats clear varnish | \approx 0.24 hours/m$^2$ |
| Flush Door & Frame (1980 x 800) | Each | Prepare and recoat (both sides) | \approx 2.90 hours/each |
| Window Frames/Sashes (Timber) | m$^2$ | Prime/clear and 2 coats (measure flat) | \approx 1.10 hours/m$^2$ |
Preparation Constants
| Task / Description | Unit | Production Rate (Average) | Labour Constant (MH/Unit) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prepare Walls (Filling, sanding, etc.) | m$^2$ | 14.2 m$^2$ per hour | \approx 0.07 hours/m$^2$ |
| Washing Down Surfaces (Apply wash, scrub, rinse) | m$^2$ | 10.0 m$^2$ per hour | \approx 0.10 hours/m$^2$ |
| Stripping Wallpaper (Standard) | m$^2$ | 7.1 m$^2$ per hour | \approx 0.14 hours/m$^2$ |
Note: Painting constants are highly sensitive to surface area (m² vs. linear meter), surface texture, and access (scaffolding/ladders).


Labour constants for installing bathroom fixtures are typically measured in man-hours per unit (hrs/no.) for "fix only" tasks, meaning the fixture is secured and connected to existing plumbing points.
These constants are usually applied to the plumber's time and assume standard, clear access.
| Fixture (Fix Only) | Unit | Man-Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| W.C. Suite (Floor Mounted Toilet) | No. | \approx 2.35 hours/unit |
| Vanity Basin | No. | \approx 1.70 hours/unit |
| Wall Basin | No. | \approx 1.75 hours/unit |
| Bath (Pressed Steel) | No. | \approx 1.40 hours/unit |
| Shower Combination Set (Fittings) | Set | \approx 3.00 hours/set |
| Stop Cock (15mm to 25mm diameter) | No. | \approx 0.25 hours/unit |
| Basin Combination Set (Taps/Faucet) | Set | \approx 0.50 hours/set |
Key Plumbing Considerations
 * Prep/Demolition: The constants above do not include removing old fixtures or making structural changes (like building wall framing for a wall-hung toilet).
 * Modifications: If plumbing lines need to be rerouted, significant additional time must be added. Simple replacements often take 2–4 hours for a professional.
 * Hourly Rate: Plumber labour rates typically range from \$90 to \$150+ per hour (depending on region and experience).

Labour constants for installing wall linings are generally measured in Man-Hours per Square Meter (MH/m²) for the "fix only" component of the work.
Finishing (stopping/jointing) is a separate but essential labour constant.
Wall Lining Labour Constants (Fix Only)
| Lining Type | Thickness / Detail | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plasterboard (Standard) | 10mm GIB® (fix only) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.20 hours/m$^2$ |
| Plasterboard (Braceline) | 10mm GIB® (fix only) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.22 hours/m$^2$ |
| Plasterboard (Thicker) | 16mm GIB® (fix only) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.26 hours/m$^2$ |
| Fibre Cement Sheet (Internal/Wet Area) | 4.5mm Hardiflex | m$^2$ | \approx 0.38 hours/m$^2$ |
| Plywood/Timber | 7.5mm, 9mm Plywood | m$^2$ | \approx 0.50 hours/m$^2$ |
| Softboard | 12mm Pinex softboard | m$^2$ | \approx 0.18 hours/m$^2$ |
Finishing/Prep Constants
| Task / Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| Stopping (Plasterboard Joints/Fixings) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.25 hours/m$^2$ |
| Tape, Joint Sand and Top Coat (Plasterboard) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.67 hours/m$^2$ (or 1.5 m$^2$/hr) |
| Skimming (Topcoat plaster to walls < 2.5m) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.15 hours/m$^2$ (or 6.7 m$^2$/hr) |
| Render for Tiling (Cement & sand, 13mm thick) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.20 hours/m$^2$ |
| Screw Fixing (Extra time allowance) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.45 hours/m$^2$ |
| Glue Fixing (Extra time allowance) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.25 hours/m$^2$ |


Labour constants for kitchens are typically focused on the assembly and installation of units, with high variability based on whether cabinetry is pre-made (flat-pack) or custom-built, and whether countertops are laminate (fitted on site) or stone (templated/fitted separately).
These constants are usually measured as Man-Hours (MH) per item or for the whole fit-out.
Kitchen Installation Labour Constants
| Task / Description | Unit | Man-Hours (Approx.) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cabinet Installation (Standard, assembled unit) | Each | \approx 1.00 - 2.00 hours/unit | Time for levelling, securing, and aligning. |
| Install Kitchen Joinery Units | Each | \approx 18.00 hours/unit | Prepare and paint (sand, UC, topcoat) an average cabinet. |
| Install Vanity Basin (Plumber time) | No. | \approx 1.70 hours/unit | Securing vanity basin to counter/wall and connecting to existing plumbing. |
| Cabinet Fitting (Full Kitchen Fit-out) | Job | \approx 120 - 200 man-hours | Total combined labour for an average-sized kitchen (carpenter/plumber/electrician). |
General Production Timelines
| Task / Description | Crew Time (Average) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Standard Cabinet Installation | 2 - 3 days | For an average kitchen (10-20 pre-made cabinets). |
| Total Kitchen Installation (Cabinets + Laminate Benchtop) | 1 - 2 days | If a laminate benchtop is used (can be fitted at the same time). |
| Total Kitchen Installation (Stone/Engineered Benchtop) | 2 - 3 weeks | The benchtop requires separate templating and installation after cabinets are set, causing the main delay. |
| Removal of Old Kitchen | \approx 1 day | Demolition and removal of existing units. |

Labour constants for carpentry removal/demolition are focused on the time required to dismantle and prepare for disposal, often measured in Labourer Hours per unit.
For demolition work, "Man-Hours" typically includes a higher ratio of general labourer time compared to skilled tradesman time, as the work is less precise.
Carpentry Removal/Demolition Constants
| Task / Description | Unit | Labourer Hours (Approx.) | Production Rate (Ave.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interior Wall (Timber frame, plasterboard lining) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.30 hours/m$^2$ | 3.3 m$^2$/hour |
| Timber Flooring (Floorboards) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.16 hours/m$^2$ | 6.2 m$^2$/hour |
| Ceiling (Lath and Plaster) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.22 hours/m$^2$ | 4.6 m$^2$/hour |
| Door (Remove and Cart away) | Each | \approx 0.30 hours/unit | 3.3 doors/hour |
| Door Frame (Remove and Cart away) | Each | \approx 0.10 hours/unit | 10.0 frames/hour |
| Skirtings/Architrave (Remove and Cart away) | m (linear) | \approx 0.06 hours/m | 16.5 m/hour |
| Staircase (Remove and Cart away) | Each | \approx 7.30 hours/unit | 0.14 stairs/hour |
| Window (Remove and Cart away, 1–2 m$^2$) | Each | \approx 0.80 hours/unit | 1.25 windows/hour |
| Floor/Ceiling Joists (Remove and Cart away) | m (linear) | \approx 1.10 hours/m | 0.9 m/hour |
Key Demolition Notes
 * Hazardous Materials: These rates do not include time for asbestos testing or removal, which significantly increases cost and duration.
 * Haulage: The times generally include carting the material away from the immediate work area, but typically exclude transport and disposal (skip hire/dump fees).
 * Structural Walls: Removing a load-bearing wall takes substantially longer (\approx 1-3 days in total, requiring bracing/beam installation) and requires professional engineering consultation.


Labour constants for timber framing are productivity rates, usually expressed as man-hours per unit of work. These figures are estimates and can vary based on crew size, experience, complexity of the build, and site conditions.
Here are some examples of labour constants for various timber framing and related tasks:
Timber Frame Installation (Man-Hours per Unit)
| Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours per Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Fix ground floor timber bearer (e.g., 100 x 75mm) | m | \approx 0.15 |
| Fix sole plates | m (linear) | \approx 0.27 |
| Ceiling Framework (Frame Installation) | m$^2$ (square meter) | \approx 2.66 |
| Framing of flooring | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 1.94 |
| Truss Fabrication | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 0.70 |
| Truss Installation | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 1.60 |
| Wooden Post Erection | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 0.85 |
| Purlins Installation | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 0.53 |
Related Finishing and Lining Labour Constants
| Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours per Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Fixing Batts (between wall framing) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.06 |
| Fixing Batts (in ceiling) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.09 |
| Building paper | m$^2$ | \approx 0.08 |
| Sisalation | m$^2$ | \approx 0.15 |
| Fixing Fibre cement sheathing (e.g., 4.5mm flat sheets) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.35 |
| Eaves soffit lining (e.g., 4.5mm fibre cement) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.52 |
| Fix standard door (solid core on 3 hinges) | Each | \approx 1.50 |
| Fix shelving (fixed to framing, e.g., 225mm x 25mm) | m | \approx 0.17 |
Key Considerations
These constants are intended as a guide for estimating and can vary significantly due to:
 * Prefabrication: Using prefabricated wall panels and trusses greatly reduces on-site labour time. Erection of a pre-assembled wall frame can sometimes take only one to two days.
 * Complexity: Intricate designs, multiple corners, and non-standard features require more time.
 * Crew Experience and Size: A skilled, large crew will achieve a faster rate (lower hours/unit).
 * Site Conditions: Difficult access or unstable ground can slow down erection.


Labour constants for weatherboard installation are typically measured as Tradesman Hours per Square Meter (MH/m²). The rate is heavily influenced by the board profile, material, and width, as this affects the overlap and number of fixings required per square meter.
Here are examples of labour constants for fixing exterior linings:
Weatherboard Labour Constants (Fix Only)
| Profile / Detail | Size (e.g., width x thickness) | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bevel Back | 150 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m$^2$ | \approx 1.00 hours/m$^2$ |
| Bevel Back | 200 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m$^2$ | \approx 0.85 hours/m$^2$ |
| Vertical Shiplap | 150 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m$^2$ | \approx 1.05 hours/m$^2$ |
| Vertical Shiplap | 200 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m$^2$ | \approx 0.85 hours/m$^2$ |
| Rusticated | 150 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m$^2$ | \approx 0.65 hours/m$^2$ |
| Rusticated | 200 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m$^2$ | \approx 0.50 hours/m$^2$ |
| Fibre Cement Sheeting (Flat sheets) | 4.5 \text{mm} thick | m$^2$ | \approx 0.35 hours/m$^2$ |
| Fibre Cement Weatherboards | 7.5 \text{mm} thick | m$^2$ | \approx 0.90 hours/m$^2$ |
| PVC / Vinyl | (General) | m$^2$ | \approx 1.00 hours/m$^2$ |
Related Exterior Labour Constants
| Task / Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| Building Paper (Moisture barrier) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.08 hours/m$^2$ |
| Sisalation (Insulation wrap) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.15 hours/m$^2$ |
| Exterior Fascia (150mm x 25mm) | m (linear) | \approx 0.26 hours/m |
Note: Narrower weatherboards and complex profiles generally result in a higher MH/m² constant because more individual boards must be installed to cover the same area.


Labour constants for installing sheet cladding are measured in Man-Hours per Square Meter (MH/m²). The rate varies significantly based on whether the sheet is flat (like fibre cement) or profiled (like metal), and on the complexity of the installation (e.g., number of penetrations, trims, and joins).
Sheet Cladding Labour Constants (Fix Only)
| Cladding Type | Profile / Detail | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Profiled Metal Cladding (Wall) | Long-run steel/aluminum (e.g., corrugated) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.15 - 0.25 hours/m$^2$ |
| Flat Fibre Cement (Fix only) | 4.5 \text{mm} to 6 \text{mm} thick | m$^2$ | \approx 0.35 hours/m$^2$ |
| Fibre Cement Sheeting (Thicker) | 7.5 \text{mm} to 9 \text{mm} thick | m$^2$ | \approx 0.45 hours/m$^2$ |
| Aluminum Composite Panel (ACP) | Fixing/installing complex panels | m$^2$ | \approx 0.40 - 0.70 hours/m$^2$ |
| Timber Plywood (External lining) | 7.5 \text{mm} to 9 \text{mm} thick | m$^2$ | \approx 0.50 hours/m$^2$ |
Key Factors Affecting Rates
 * Profiled Metal is generally the fastest to install per \text{m}^2 because large sheets cover a lot of area quickly. However, complexity from flashings and trims significantly adds time.
 * Fibre Cement is slower due to the need for precise cutting, sealing of joins, and handling heavier materials to prevent breakage.
 * Complexity: The constants are for large, simple areas. Any project with many joins, penetrations (windows/pipes), or 90-degree internal/external corners will increase the \text{MH/m}^2 rate significantly as these areas require detailed cutting and flashing.
 * Substrate: The rate assumes the substrate (framing/battens) is already correctly installed.



Labour constants for installing external trim (or exterior finishings) are typically measured in Tradesman Hours per Linear Meter (MH/m). The size and complexity (e.g., thickness, need for intricate corner cuts) of the trim affect the time required.
Here are examples of labour constants for fixing common external trim components:
Exterior Trim Labour Constants (Fix Only)
| Trim Component | Size (e.g., width) | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fascia Board | 150 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} (standard) | m (linear) | \approx 0.26 hours/m |
| Fascia Board | 200 \text{mm} \times 40 \text{mm} (larger) | m (linear) | \approx 0.33 hours/m |
| Small Trim/Beads | 25 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} to 50 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m (linear) | \approx 0.15 hours/m |
| Medium Trim | 50 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} to 100 \text{mm} \times 25 \text{mm} | m (linear) | \approx 0.17 hours/m |
| Eaves Soffit Lining (Fibre cement) | 4.5 \text{mm} to 6 \text{mm} thick | m$^2$ (area) | \approx 0.52 hours/m$^2$ |
Installation Time Notes
 * Complexity: The constants are averages for straight runs. Complex corners, multiple joins, and working at height (requiring scaffolding or advanced ladder setup) will significantly increase the total time and thus the effective labour constant.
 * Finish Work: These constants cover the fixing only. They exclude preparatory painting (undercoating/sealing cut ends) and finish painting, which are separate line items in estimating.






Labour constants for installing building hardware are typically very small, unit-based figures, measured in Hours per Unit (hrs/no.). These tasks are generally performed by skilled carpenters or locksmiths.
Since dedicated constants for items like hinges and locks are often internal or proprietary, here are common constants for individual fixtures that include hardware fitting, as well as general hardware constants where available:
Building Hardware & Fixture Constants
| Task / Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours (Approx.) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hang Door (Solid core standard door on 3 hinges) | Each | \approx 1.50 hours/unit | Includes hinge fitting, but often excludes lock-set installation. |
| Install Lock-Set (Cylinder/Knob/Latch only, in pre-bored door) | Each | \approx 0.50 hours/unit | Estimated for simple fit-off of the main lock-set. |
| W.C. Suite (Floor Mounted Toilet, fix only) | No. | \approx 2.35 hours/unit | Includes all necessary securing hardware. |
| Fix Vanity Basin (In place) | Each | \approx 0.80 hours/unit | Securing the basin to the counter/vanity. |
| Shower Combination Set (Taps/Mixer/Head, fix only) | Set | \approx 3.00 hours/set | Detailed fixture installation time. |
| Pillar Tap (Basin/Sink) | Set | \approx 0.35 hours/set | Simple fitting time. |
Door Preparation Constants
 * A door that requires custom cutting, boring for the lock-set, and mortising for hinges (slab door into old jamb) can take a practiced carpenter 2 to 3 hours to complete the hanging and hardware fitting.
 * Installing a pre-hung door is much faster, often taking 2.5 hours or less for the complete unit.
