Labour constants for timber framing are productivity rates, usually expressed as man-hours per unit of work. These figures are estimates and can vary based on crew size, experience, complexity of the build, and site conditions.
Here are some examples of labour constants for various timber framing and related tasks:
Timber Frame Installation (Man-Hours per Unit)
| Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours per Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Fix ground floor timber bearer (e.g., 100 x 75mm) | m | \approx 0.15 |
| Fix sole plates | m (linear) | \approx 0.27 |
| Ceiling Framework (Frame Installation) | m$^2$ (square meter) | \approx 2.66 |
| Framing of flooring | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 1.94 |
| Truss Fabrication | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 0.70 |
| Truss Installation | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 1.60 |
| Wooden Post Erection | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 0.85 |
| Purlins Installation | BF (Board Foot) | \approx 0.53 |
Related Finishing and Lining Labour Constants
| Description | Unit | Tradesman Hours per Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Fixing Batts (between wall framing) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.06 |
| Fixing Batts (in ceiling) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.09 |
| Building paper | m$^2$ | \approx 0.08 |
| Sisalation | m$^2$ | \approx 0.15 |
| Fixing Fibre cement sheathing (e.g., 4.5mm flat sheets) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.35 |
| Eaves soffit lining (e.g., 4.5mm fibre cement) | m$^2$ | \approx 0.52 |
| Fix standard door (solid core on 3 hinges) | Each | \approx 1.50 |
| Fix shelving (fixed to framing, e.g., 225mm x 25mm) | m | \approx 0.17 |
Key Considerations
These constants are intended as a guide for estimating and can vary significantly due to:
 * Prefabrication: Using prefabricated wall panels and trusses greatly reduces on-site labour time. Erection of a pre-assembled wall frame can sometimes take only one to two days.
 * Complexity: Intricate designs, multiple corners, and non-standard features require more time.
 * Crew Experience and Size: A skilled, large crew will achieve a faster rate (lower hours/unit).
 * Site Conditions: Difficult access or unstable ground can slow down erection.
