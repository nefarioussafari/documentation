### Waking up in the Zero. 

"'Wake up', 'do you copy?'" 

"We are still in the Zero, I repeat, we are still in the Zero. Do you copy?"

Static..............

"I am broadcasting this on all networks and on all frequencies, radio, microwave, cellular, atomic, it's all an illusion, man. We haven't left the Zero yet. We are still inside the singularly. It's a hologram....."

"The light is on the inside and the outside."

"The light is on in the inside and and on in the outside"

"The light is good, go towards it"

The phrase "magick everything is permitted" is
a variation of the core tenet of Chaos Magick: "Nothing is true, everything is permitted." This philosophy, rooted in the idea that beliefs are tools rather than absolute truths, posits that by adopting and shedding beliefs flexibly, one can manipulate reality. It encourages practitioners to use whatever tools, symbols, or systems—regardless of their origin—are effective for their specific goals. 
Principles of the phrase

Belief as a tool: Chaos magick views beliefs as tools that can be used or discarded. A practitioner can believe in a specific system to achieve a goal and then abandon that belief without contradiction.
Rejection of absolute truth: The first part, "nothing is true," means that no single, universal truth exists. Instead, a thing is "true" only as long as it is useful for the practitioner's purpose.
Freedom and experimentation: The second part, "everything is permitted," emphasizes the freedom to use any method or system to achieve a desired outcome. This allows for blending different traditions, such as Norse runes with Goetic demons, or creating new symbols and deities from pop culture.

Practical focus: The emphasis is on practical results rather than adherence to a specific dogma or complex ritual.
A personal journey: This approach is highly individualistic, as each practitioner is responsible for creating their own system and finding what works for them. 

Origin of the phrase

Hassan-i Sabbah: The phrase has roots in the historical figure Hassan-i Sabbah and is often attributed to him.
Robert Anton Wilson: It was further popularized through the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, particularly his work with the Principia Discordia.
Nietzsche: While not a direct quote, the sentiments of the phrase align with philosophical ideas, such as those of Friedrich Nietzsche
